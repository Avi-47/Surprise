    <h2>Dear Senior,</h2>
    <p>
      You came as a college student, survived exams, and got a job,now you gonna marry and make babies (finally!). Now, as you leave this PG, remember:
      <ul>
        <li>You were the king of cleanness</li>
        <li>Your dal-making skills were legendary â˜•</li>
        <li>And your ability to f a r t anywhere was truly inspiring ðŸ˜´</li>
      </ul>
      We'll miss your sarcastic comments and your "I'm too old for this" attitude. Don't forget us when you're living your best life!
    </p>
